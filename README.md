KRules is a project in progress and we are working hard on a first widely usable version.

Documentation has not yet been released.

If you are interested in getting an idea of the project you can meanwhile take a look at this [introductory material](https://intro.krules.io) in which the general concepts are explained.

Do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:info@airspot.tech) if you are interested in further information.
